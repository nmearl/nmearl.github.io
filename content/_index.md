I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the Department of Astronomy. My research focuses on accretion physics, galaxy evolution, and cosmology using rare transient events. I utilize novel machine learning techniques to analyze massive photometric survey data, aiding in the discovery of unique astrophysical phenomena.

Additionally, I contribute to open-source astronomical software packages and develop data analysis tools and educational platforms to make astronomy more accessible.

In my free time, I enjoy developing video games, reading science fiction, and savoring good craft beer.
